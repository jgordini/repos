<h3 id="s_1-0">1.0 Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The objective of this standard for research data security requirements is to
  assist the UAB research community in the protections requirements of data and
  systems.
</p>
<h3 id="s_2-0">2.0 Scope and Applicability</h3>
<p>
  All UAB research data stored, processed, or transmitted must be protected in
  accordance with these standards. Based on the regulatory or contractual
  requirements of the award; researchers are required to implement appropriate
  security controls.
</p>
<p>
  Researchers are encouraged to consult with their department IT support, as
  needed. Many of the protections described herein are provided with
  UABIT-supported servers and networks, and would not require any additional
  technical investments by the researchers.
</p>
<h3 id="s_3-0">3.0 Classification of Research Data</h3>
<p>
  The classification of research data depends on several factors such as type of
  data, and/or contractual elements and thus may fall into any of the
  classifications defined herein. Likewise, time of release and collaboration
  effect the classification of research data. As such, certain unpublished
  research data may be classified as private or sensitive until such time the
  research is published.
</p>
<p>
  Likewise, intellectual property that has not been disclosed to or protected by
  the IIE may need to be classified as sensitive. Additionally, federal laws,
  rules and regulations (including but not limited to FISMA, HIPAA, FERPA, and
  Export Controls), sponsor requirements, and UAB policies and guidelines will
  necessitate a certain classification.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >It is incumbent upon the Researcher to know the type of data, the
    circumstances governing the data, and classify it accordingly.</strong
  >
  Once classified, the Researcher will need to maintain the data using the
  appropriate UAB system of record or database with the appropriate access and
  security controls aligning to the classification standard. For example, not
  all UAB data storage options are recommended for sensitive data.
</p>
<p>
  Research data shall also be maintained in accordance with UAB’s
  <a href="https://secure2.compliancebridge.com/uab/portal/getdoc.php?file=326"
    >Record Retention Policy</a
  >
  and record retention schedule. For more information about protected research
  data please refer to the UAB OVPRED.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      ensure compliance with policies and regulatory requirements related to the
      information.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      UAB’s central Information Technology (IT) units shall be responsible for
      protecting all Institutional Data maintained/stored in the institutional
      information systems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributed Information Technology (IT) units shall be responsible for
      protecting all Institutional Data maintained/stored in unit level
      information systems.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="s_3-4">3.4 UAB Information Security</h4>
<p>
  Members of the UAB Information Security team are responsible for developing
  and implementing an information security program as well as the supporting
  data security and protection policies, standards and procedures.
</p>
<h4 id="s_3-5">3.5 Information Security Liaison (ISL)</h4>
<p>
  Each unit senior manager will designate at least one ISL who will act as a
  liaison to the UAB information Security Team. ISLs oversee information
  security responsibilities for the units and schools, including assisting with
  security awareness and security incident response.
</p>
<h4 id="s_3-6">3.6 System Administrators</h4>
<p>
  System Administrators are individuals within the central IT/HSIS or
  school/units with day-to-day responsibility for maintaining information
  systems.
</p>
<h4 id="s_3-7">3.7 Data Users</h4>
<p>
  Data Users are individuals authorized to access UAB data and are responsible
  for protecting the information assets on a daily basis through adherence to
  UAB policies.
</p>
<h4 id="s_4-0">4.0 Protection Requirements Based on Classification</h4>
<p>
  The table below defines minimum protection requirements for each category of
  data when being used or handled in a specific context (e.g.&nbsp;Sensitive
  Data sent in an email message). Please note that these protections are not
  intended to supersede any regulatory or contractual requirements for handling
  data.
